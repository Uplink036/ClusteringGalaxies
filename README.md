# ClusteringGalaxies
Project work from the course DV2599

# Introduction 

# How to build (local)
## Prerequistes
You need to be able to run jupyter notebook and have the pacakges in the [requriments](./requirements.txt) downloaded.

You also need the galaxy zoo dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge).

### Unzip image data
## Build 
Install python pacakges using (in root) 

```bash

pip install -r requriments.txt 

```
Get and unzip the files in the root folder of the project. 

## Run 
Run your jupyter notebook by entering 
```bash

jupyter notebook 

```
in the terminal

# How to build (devcontainer)
## Prerequistes
You need a system capable of running dockers and devcontainers. This was done on a ubuntu machine, running the devcontainer exstension, but other ways work as well. 

You also need the galaxy zoo dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge).

### Unzip image data
## Build 


## Run 
Run the container by pressing ctrl-shift-p in vs code and hit the *dev container: reopen in container* to start it up. If it's your first time, it will take a while, but afterwards you have a controlled enviroment that will be the same for others. 

Run your jupyter notebook by entering 
```bash

jupyter notebook 

```
in the terminal
